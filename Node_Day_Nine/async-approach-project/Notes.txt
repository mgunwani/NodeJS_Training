Async Approach:

    In this approach, the lines of code executed in different 
    order than the one in which they are written.

Sync Approach:

    In this approach, the code is executed line by line. They execute
    in the order in which they are written.

Callback hell:

doSomething1(()=>{
    doSomething2(() => {
        doSomething3(() => {
            doSomething4(() => {

            })
        })
    })
})

Use Promises for Conscise Async Programing:

promiseFunction()
    .then(fulfilledCallback)
    .then(fulfilledCallback)
    .catch(rejectedCallback)

Async/Await Keyword for Async-Programming:

async function() {
    await [Async Action]
}
